This repository is my first approach to DDD (Domain Driven Design) in Golang and it is in part taken from [Three Dots Lab - Github](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example)

For more information about DDD and understanding about the implementation of this pattern, please read [Three Dots Lab - Golang Repository Pattern](https://threedots.tech/post/repository-pattern-in-go/)
